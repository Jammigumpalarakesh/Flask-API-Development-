# Flask-API-Development-
This project demonstrates a Flask-based RESTful API built for handling backend operations efficiently. It focuses on creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) data through well-structured endpoints. The API integrates with a database for persistent storage and follows clean architecture and modular coding practices.
